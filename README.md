# Pencil Me In

Pencil Me In is a group project. We developed it to experiment with node, express, and developing our own API. The back end is MySQL. We use JSON web tokens for authentication and a library called fullCalendar for the gui calendar. The idea is that small business/gig workers can have clients log in and schedule their own appointments with them. Providers can also create appointments for blocks of time that they don't want clients to schedule them. When registering, providers choose their business hours and these are emphasized in the calendar to show clients where to create appointments. Feel free to register as a client or provider and check it out.
